 <h1 style="color:  #0f0e0e;">Bio</h1>
<br>
Md Saydur Rahman, Research Engineer at **Akkodis**, Inc., spearheading innovation in **General Motors'** Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) projects through advanced system design, coding, and on-road testing. I develop cutting-edge CAV systems, seamlessly integrating wireless networks, cloud, and edge computing to enhance driving safety and transportation efficiency.

I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). I worked as a Research Assistant under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~yhua/" style="color: blue;">Yingbo Hua</a>. My research interest involves Autonomous Vehicle Mapping, Wireless Security, 5G Low-latency Communication, and Domain adaptation-based Deep learning.
